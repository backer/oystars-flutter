## OyStars: Privacy policy

Welcome to the OyStars mobile app!

This is a simple mobile app developed by Brian Acker. The app is simply for viewing the rec sports stats of OyStars team members from the team's performance in local recreational sports leagues over the years.

I take privacy very seriously, and this app has not been programmed to collect any user data whatsoever.
It is simply intended to make viewing team and individual stats on the go more convenient for players and friends.

All app data can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it, but currently no app is set by the user on the client side so all data viewed in the app is for display purposes only.

If you find any security vulnerability or have any questions or concerns regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email at oystars.org@gmail.com
